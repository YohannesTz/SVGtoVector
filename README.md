## SVGtoVector

a simple web tool to convert scalable vector graphics to android's vector asset. I know 
[there exists](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/vector-asset-studio) similar feature on 
[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). but sometimes you might not want to fire up
AS or just tired of opening dialogs (I know I am üòÅ). this is my first NextJs app so go easy on me. pull requests are welcome
